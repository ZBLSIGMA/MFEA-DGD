## Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Diffusion Gradient Descent (MFEA-DGD)

This is the matlab code for implementing the MFEA-DGD algorithm presented in the paper:
"Multifactorial Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Diffusion Gradient Descent".
<br>
<br>


## Algorithm Introduction

The proposed MFEA-DGD algorithm incorporates new reproduction operators and an effective hyper-rectangle search strategy. The proposed MFEA-DGD is characterized by innovative crossover and mutation operators that simulate the dynamics of the DGD algorithm. In addition, a hyper rectangular search strategy is introduced to allow MFEA-DGD to explore more underdeveloped areas in the unified express space of all tasks and the subspace of each task.
